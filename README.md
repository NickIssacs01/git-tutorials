# BMI calculator
In this project, we are going to write a python program to calculate the BMI.

Measurement:

1. Weight(kgs)
2. Height(m)

BMI = Weight/(Height * Height)

We will use the BMI to determine whether the user is Overweight, Normal or Underweight

## Results:

If BMI > 24 then the patient is Overweight

If BMI is between 18 and 25, the person is Normal

If BMI < 18 then the patient is Underweight
